# Emmy API Verification Service

The Eligibility Made Easy (Emmy) API is an open-source tool developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that enables states to access additional data sources for eligibility determinations. The Emmy API integrates with state systems via backend connections and does not provide a user interface. It supplements, not replaces, a state’s eligibility processes.

## About the Project

This project evolved out of the [IVaaS](https://github.com/DSACMS/iv-cbv-payroll "IVaaS repository") tool for consent based verification. As the need for more complex forms of validation developed, it became clear that providing a way for agencies to integrate directly with an API was becoming increasingly useful, particularly for ex parte renewals. The ultimate goals of this and related projects is to remove as much friction as possible between the applicant and receiving their benefits by reducing the burden placed on them to manually provide evidence of eligibility.

The ​​Emmy API connects to federal and commercial data sources and queries them on behalf of the state to facilitate eligibility determination. The result is a standardized, structured response that the state can use to determine a person’s eligibility.

## Local Development

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/ "pre-commit Docs") to register git hooks that run our various linters. You can [install](https://pre-commit.com/#install "Installation Instructions") pre-commit and then run:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

For OpenAPI spec maintenance, the repo also includes utility scripts under
`scripts/`:

```sh
# 1. Rebuild the bundled YAML and JSON artifacts from the design-time source spec
./scripts/bundle-api-spec

# 2. Validate the bundled YAML artifact
./scripts/validate-api-spec

# 3. Lint the bundled YAML artifact with the repo Spectral ruleset
./scripts/lint-api-spec

# 4. Lint hand-authored YAML files
./scripts/lint-yaml-files

# 5. Check formatting for contract YAML and JSON files
./scripts/check-format-contract-files

# 6. Compile standalone JSON Schemas
./scripts/check-json-schemas

# 7. Check for breaking OpenAPI changes against a base ref
./scripts/check-openapi-breaking [base-ref]
```

If you use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), install the pinned runtimes from
`mise.toml` and run:

```sh
# Install the pinned Go and Node runtimes for this repo
mise install

# Run the full local contract/spec workflow
mise run check-contract-files
```

You can also run each step individually with `mise run bundle-api-spec`,
`mise run validate-api-spec`, `mise run lint-api-spec`,
`mise run lint-yaml-files`, `mise run check-format-contract-files`,
`mise run check-json-schemas`, and `mise run check-openapi-breaking`.
